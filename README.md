Simple pipeline for SSR + hydration of Lit components in your [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) site.

[Check out the demo site repo](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/lit-renderer-example), or keep reading to get started.

## Installation

Run this command to add this plugin to your site's Gemfile, along with Lit 2 and Lit's SSR support:

```shell
$ bundle add bridgetown-lit-renderer -g bridgetown_plugins

$ yarn add bridgetown-lit-renderer lit @lit-labs/ssr
```

Create a file in `config/lit-ssr.config.js` with the following:

```js
const build = require("bridgetown-lit-renderer/build")

// You can customize this as you wish, perhaps add new esbuild plugins
const esbuildOptions = {}

build(esbuildOptions)
```

Add the following to the top of your `frontend/javascript/index.js` file:

```js
import "bridgetown-lit-renderer"
import "./lit-components"
```

For the purposes of testing your install, add the following to `frontend/javascript/lit-components.js`:

```js
import "lit/experimental-hydrate-support.js"
import { LitElement, html, css } from "lit"

export class HappyDaysElement extends LitElement {
  static styles = css`
    :host {
      display: block;
      border: 2px dashed gray;
      margin: 4px;
      padding: 4px;
      width: 20vw;
    }
  `

  static properties = {
    hello: { type: String }
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <p>Hello ${this.hello}! ${Date.now()}</p>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('happy-days', HappyDaysElement)
```

Finally, create a new `.erb` page somewhere in `src`, and add this somewhere in your template:

```erb
<%= lit data: {hello: "there"} do %>
  <happy-days hello="${data.hello}"></happy-days>
<% end %>
```

Now start up your Bridgetown site, visit the page, and if all goes well, you should see a box containing "Hello there!" and a timestamp when the page was first rendered.

You can reload the page several times and see that the timestamp doesn't change, because Lit's SSR + Hydration support knows not to re-render the component. However, if you change the `hello` attribute in the HTML, you'll get a re-render and thus see a new timestamp. _How cool is that?!_

### Usage and Configuration Options

The `lit` helper works in any Ruby template language and let's you pass data down to the Lit SSR build process. As long as your `data` value is an object that can be converted to JSON (via Ruby's `to_json`), you're set. In fact, you can even pass your page/resource front matter along for the ride:

```erb
<%= lit data: resource.data do %>
  <page-header title="${data.title}"></page-header>
<% end %>
```

When the component is hydrated, it will utilize the same data that was passed at build time and avoid a client-side re-render. However, from that point forward you're free to mutate component attribute/properties to trigger re-renders as normal. [Check out Lit's `firstUpdated` method](https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/#reactive-update-cycle-completing) as a good place to start.

You also have the option of choosing a different entry point (aka your JS file that contains or imports one or more Lit components). The default is `./frontend/javascript/lit-components.js`, but you can specify any other file you wish (the path should be relative to your project root).

```erb
<%= lit data: resource.data, entry: "./frontend/javascript/components/headers.js" do %>
  <page-header title="${data.title}"></page-header>
<% end %>
```

This would typically coincide with a strategy of having multiple Webpack entry points, and loading different entry points on different parts of your site. An exercise left for the readerâ€¦
